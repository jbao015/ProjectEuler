# Problem
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

# Solution 1

Simple, for any m by n grid, the number of ways to get from the top left to the top right is simply the number of ways you can order the m "down" and n "right" operations. Therefore, your answer is simply 40!/20!/20! = 137846528820
